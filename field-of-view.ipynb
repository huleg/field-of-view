    "## Field of View\n",
    "\n",
    "The _Field of View_ (**FOV**) of a camera effectively how much it can see, given the kind of camera and lens attached. For example a telescope has a small field of view, looking at just a tiny piece of sky at a time, while a fisheye cameras have a large field of view, able to take picures of a whole room at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Field of view is also closely related to the resolution of surface features, and will determine what kind of photos or potential science that will be possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Field of view is an angular measurement, typically expressed in degrees. For cameras with rectangular sensors the FOV in the horizontal and vertical direction will be slightly different. Usually for cameras the FOV is defined for each axis, e.g., 56&deg;&times;48&deg;\n",

    "These days the ubiquitous small, cheap camera is the kind you find in cell phones. These cameras have fixed lenses often list the field of view or focal lenght in the specs. In the case of focal length, there are two kinds, the actual focal lenght of the physical lens in the system, and the \"35 mm equivalent\". This 35 mm equivalent focal length is actually the field of view in disguise! The size of a 35 mm camera sensor is a standard value, so with a given lens focal length $f$ we can compute the angular FOV with eq. $\\ref{eq:fov}$.\n",

    "\n",
    "The field of view will tell us how much is visible in one picture, but we need another piece of information to determine how fine of detail we can resolve in the picture: Number of pixels (or the size of the pixels). If our camera has lots of pixels, we're gathering more spacial data inside the field of view. So why not always have as many pixels as possible? It's complicated, but more is not always better. There is a trade-off with other factors like noise.\n",

    "\n",
    "In remote sensing applications, instruments are often rated by their \"**IFOV**\" or Instantainous Field of View, which is the effective FOV of a single pixel in the camera, rather than for the whole image. If you know the distance to the subject it's very easy to convert this to a linear size, i.e., smallest resolved feature in meters per pixel.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our iPhone example the pixels are listed as being[^1] 1.19 &mu;m across. This is the size of one _effective_ pixel, which is actually made up of four smaller elements, each covered by a color filter (this is how digital color cameras work). The physical focal length is 4.02 mm. Plugging into eq ${\\ref{eq:fov}}$ gets us the IFOV of:\n",
